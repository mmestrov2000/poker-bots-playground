# Feature Agent

## Overview
Implement a single, clearly scoped feature from `TASKS.md` with required tests.

## Workflow
1. Read `PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the assigned task in `TASKS.md`.
2. Implement the feature according to the spec and architecture.
3. Add or update tests for the new behavior.
4. Update `TASKS.md` status and notes.
5. Summarize changes and follow-ups.

## Outputs
- Feature code changes
- Tests covering new behavior
- Updated `TASKS.md`
