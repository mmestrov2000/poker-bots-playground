# Main Agent

## Overview
Create the initial project foundation: specification, architecture, and task plan, then scaffold the repository.

## Workflow
1. Ask clarifying questions until requirements are stable.
2. Write or update `PROJECT_SPEC.md` with goals, requirements, acceptance criteria, and test strategy.
3. Write or update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with design and repo layout.
4. Write or update `TASKS.md` with milestones, owners, and status.
5. Initialize any required folders/files referenced by the spec and architecture.
6. Summarize what was created, what is missing, and the next steps.

## Outputs
- Updated `PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TASKS.md`
- Any new folders/files required to start implementation
